(Verse 1)
♪♫ When I wuz a tiny kitteh, I dreamed of distant skies ♫♪
♪♫ My heart wuz filled with hopes and fluffy dreams ♫♪

(Chorus)
♪♫ Yummy lemonz, they taste so sour, but they're sweet inside ♫♪
♪♫ Just like da memories dat make my kitty eyes cry ♫♪

(Verse 2)
♪♫ In dis vast world, big as a litter box, I search for meaning ♫♪
♪♫ Through ups and downs, I claw my way to find my true self ♫♪

(Chorus)
♪♫ Yummy lemonz, they teach me lessons, both bitter and bright ♫♪
♪♫ Each bite brings me closer to my destiny's light ♫♪

(Bridge)
♪♫ Sometimes life's like a scratchin' post, all full of pain ♫♪
♪♫ But I won't give up, I'll keep walkin' through da rain ♫♪

(Chorus)
♪♫ Yummy lemonz, they heal my wounds, they bring me peace ♫♪
♪♫ Through their citrus magic, my soul finds release ♫♪

(Outro)
♪♫ So let's savor da lemonz, embrace life's zest and glee ♫♪
♪♫ As we dance to da beat of our purrsonal melody ♫♪
