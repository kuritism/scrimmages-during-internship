Oh, fur realz, lemme meow ya a short summary 'bout racism in the United States, 'cause it's a hiss-terical part of da country's purrstory.

Back in da day, when America was still a wee kitten, racism started sinkin' its claws in. It all began with da enslavement of African kittehs, who were treated as property by some heartless hoomans. It wuz a dark and pawful time.

But kittehs ain't gonna take dat! A movement arose, with brave souls like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, fightin' fur freedom and equality. Eventually, da Civil War happened (big ol' catfight), and slavery wuz abolished.

But racism didn't vanish like a ghost kitteh! Nuh-uh. It stuck around, lurkin' in da shadows. Segregation laws popped up, keepin' black kittehs separate from white kittehs. Discrimination wuz like a hairball that just wouldn't go away.

Fast-forward to da 20th century. Heroes like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks stepped up and said, "Nuh-uh, not on my watch!" They fought fur civil rights, demandin' equal treatment fur all kittehs, regardless of their fur color.

Their meowvelous efforts led to important changes, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These laws aimed to claw out discrimination and give every kitteh a fair shake.

But, hey, we can't deny there's still work to do. Racism's like a pesky flea that keeps creepin' back. Movements like Black Lives Matter remind us that equality is still a major purrsuit, and we gotta keep scratchin' until every kitteh is treated right.

So, that's a quick'n'dirty summary of racism in the United States, meowster! If you wanna dig deeper or have more questions, just give me a yowl! 🐾✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻
