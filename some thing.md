This is a story about a smol lil raccoon named pebbicoab.
The first time I ever met pebbicoab was at a bar.
It was a quiet night. Just me, a few old friends, and some drinks.
I was sitting in the corner of the bar, reading a book, when I felt a hand on my shoulder.
"Hello there, what's your name?"
I turned to see a raccoon sitting at the stool next to me.
"Luna," I said. "And yours?"
"Pebbicoab," the raccoon replied.
"That's an... interesting name."
"I thought so too, but apparently it means something special in my family."
"Oh? What does it mean?"
"You're going to laugh."
"I'll try not to."
"It's raccoon for 'little stone.'"
I'm still not sure if I should have laughed or not.
"Well, good for you."
"I guess so," pebbicoab shrugged.
I looked back down at my book, not really in the mood for conversation.
"I know what you're thinking."
I looked up. "What?"
"I know what you're thinking."
"Look, peb-what's-your-name, I don't think you know anything about me."
"But I do. I know what you're thinking because I'm thinking it too. We're all thinking it."
I raised an eyebrow. "And what am I thinking?"
Pebbicoab looked at me, eyes narrowed. "chicken butt"
"What?!"
"You're thinking 'that raccoon is talking out of their ass, and I should tell them off before they say something worse.'"
I sighed. "Look, pebb- whatever your name is, just let me read, okay?"
"It's not pebb- whatever, it's pebbicoab."
"Okay, pebbicoab, just let me read, alright? I'll get you a drink or something."
Pebbicoab smiled. "That sounds good. I'll take a milk, please."
"Are you sure you're a raccoon?"
"I'm sure you're a raccoon."
"How'd you figure that out?"
"I just know."
I shook my head, chuckling. "Well, if you're going to be a pain in the ass, you can buy your own milk."
"Okay, okay. I'll be a good little raccoon and buy my own milk."
I laughed as pebbicoab headed to the bar.
When I got back to reading, I was suddenly struck by a thought.
"Hey pebbicoab, didn't you say you were thinking 'chicken butt'?"
"I did, yes."
"But... don't raccoons like, eat chickens?"
Pebbicoab smiled. "erm..."
I raised an eyebrow. "Is that right?"
"Erm, no, actually. Not at all. It's a common misconception."
"Oh? How so?"
"We don't eat them."
"Really?"
"No. We only eat fruit."
"Then why does everyone think you do?"
"It's because raccoons are fruity"
